    "\n",
    "1. The \"vanishing gradients\" problem occurs when the gradients of the loss function become very small as they are propagated backwards through the layers of a deep neural network during training. This makes the weights of the initial layers change very little, effectively preventing the network from learning. The \"exploding gradients\" problem is when the gradients become very large, causing the weights to change drastically during training, which can make the learning process unstable and the network's performance worse.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. We can look at the depth of the network as the 'size' of the 'chain' in the famous chain rule. If the weights or the derivative of the activation function are small (less than 1), repeatedly multiplying them across many layers can cause the gradients to become vanishingly small. If the weights or the derivative of the activation function are large (greater than 1), repeatedly multiplying them across many layers can cause the gradients to become very large.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Vanishing gradients: Consider a deep network with 100 layers, all using the sigmoid activation function, where all the weights are initialized to 0.5. The derivative of the sigmoid function at 0.5 is approximately 0.25. So, after 100 layers, the gradient would shrink to approximately $(0.25)^{100}$, which is practically zero. Exploding gradients: assuming all weights were initialized to 2. After 100 layers, the gradient would have grown to $2^{100}$, which is larger than all the atoms in the universe.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. If the network is suffering from the vanishing gradients problem, we will see the training loss decreases very slowly or getting stuck. If the network is suffering from exploding gradients, the training process can become unstable, and the loss may become NaN or infinity due to numerical overflow. You may also see very large fluctuations in the loss over time.\n",

Further, it would not be able to meaningfully process words that it hasn't encountered during training, limiting its generalization capability.

With attention, the decoder utilizes all the encoder's hidden states at each timestamp, effectively searching the whole sequence's latent space to select the best word. This process allows the encoder's hidden states to translate each word more effectively rather than compressing the entire sequence, and the attention mechanism provides a sort of feedback that helps select the most appropriate next word.\n",

Using self-attention, where keys, queries, and values all originate from the encoder's hidden states, the model is expected to gain a more nuanced and detailed understanding of the relationships and dependencies within the source sequence itself. Self-attention allows each part of the sequence to \"look\" at every other part, thereby capturing the internal structure of the sequence. It enables the hidden states to focus more on the relationships within themselves, fostering a deeper understanding of both local and long-range dependencies in the data. As a result, the learned hidden states should be better at modeling the complexity of the input sequence.
